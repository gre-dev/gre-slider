## Requirements

## Get Started
All you need to install this plugin is to include **Jquery** and **gre-slider.min.js**, before the closing of **body** tag of the page (`</body>`) as shown below:

````html5
<script src="js/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="js/gre-slider.min.js"></script>
````

then we will add our slider code and place it anywhere we want, the stracture of the code should be as following:

````html5
<div id="gre-slider">
    <div id="per-gre-slider" data-img="images/golden-gate-bridge.jpg"></div>
    <div id="per-gre-slider" data-img="images/utah.jpg"></div>
    <div id="per-gre-slider" data-img="images/road.jpg"></div>
    <div id="per-gre-slider" data-img="images/sky.jpg"></div>
    <div id="per-gre-slider" data-img="images/dawn.jpg"></div>
</div>
````

you can add images as you like but you've to change the **"data-img"** to the image link.
<br>

After completing all the previous steps, let's add this code before the end of the body tag of our page as following:

````javascript
$(document).ready(() => {
	$('#gre-slider').greSlider({
		fullscreen: false,
		width: 700,
		height: 400,
		autoPlay: true
	});
});
````
Now the slider is ready to run on your page!
